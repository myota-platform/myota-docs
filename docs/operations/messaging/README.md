# Messaging and NATS

- [JetStream administration and status](jetstream-admin-status.md) — read-only
  broker state and sampled history.
- [NATS event migration plan](nats-event-migration-plan.md) — Phases 0 and 1
  contract/topology work are complete. The delegated review dispositioned all
  68 fact schemas and accepted a cluster-internal trust boundary without NATS
  auth/TLS. The bounded work schemas, create-only provisioner, fail-closed
  opt-in Helm pre-upgrade gate, accepted capacity limits, and local restore/replay
  evidence are recorded. Runtime paths and production cutover remain Phase 2.
- [JetStream recovery and replay runbook](jetstream-recovery.md) — selected
  PostgreSQL recovery authority, isolated restore/replay procedure, and remaining
  qualification evidence.
- [Phase 0 event and work inventory](nats-event-migration-inventory.md) —
  repository evidence, current queues, replay limits, mirror status, and
  selected topology. The decision is recorded in
  [ADR-0008](../../architecture/decisions/0008-nats-jetstream-event-and-work-topology.md).
- [Joint review](evidence/phase1-joint-review-2026-10-10.md), [Phase 1 completion evidence](evidence/phase1-completion-2026-10-10.md), [historical 9 October evidence](evidence/phase1-contract-topology-2026-10-09.md), and
  [current/target topology diagrams](../../architecture/diagrams/nats-event-migration.md).
